# Cancer Risk Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
Predicts cancer risk using Linear Regression based on medical and demographic data.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install necessary dependencies.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the project file.

## Implementation
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing correlations, feature importance.
- Model Training: Linear Regression with evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.

## Future Improvements
- Implement advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Expand the dataset for better accuracy.
